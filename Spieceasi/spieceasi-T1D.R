# It does not simply generate a matrix of Pearson correlation coefficients, but instead it tries to determine or 
# generate a newtork of conditional dependencies between taxa. Standard correlations using relative abundances may provide 
# false associations simply by having different absolute abundances.

# It asks if taxa X and Y are associated after taking into account the rest of the taxa in the system/dataset.
# Rows = samples, columns = taxa. Use raw or filtered counts.

# Log-ratio transforms the data, selects the best model with 'pulsar using stars', and fits the final estimate with the method of choice:
# Both 'mb' and 'glasso' are methods to infer conditional dependency between taxa. The first is neighborhood selection, and it 
# uses the lasso regression ().

# Step 1: Data input as columns taxa, and rows samples. 
# Step 2: Filter data if needed (i.e. sample prevalence, or rare taxa).
# Step 3: CLR transformation of each taxon. This gives us a CLR matrix. 
# Step 4: Use LASSO regression to minimize the RSS + lambda(sum(betas)), where each beta is a coefficient for each taxa. We use one taxon at a time
# as the response variable (the CLR value) and the rest of the taxa*beta as the predictors. We iterate each beta to minimize the RSS + lambda(sum(betas)) as much
# as we can while keeping the simplest model possible. All samples are used at once to iterate over all betas for all the response variables. Once the best model is found,
# then repeat with a new Lambda value. A coefficient is kept if the reduction of the RSS is worth the increase in penalty.
# SPIEC-EASI chooses the sparsest network that remains stable across many subsampling with many lambda values. If it sees an edge is kept, then we know it holds.
# The tradeoff between RSS reduction and model simplicity is determined by the lambda parameter. The higher the lambda, the more we penalize the model for having more edges, and thus the sparser the network.

# Neighborhood selection (mb) first, glasso second, and sparcc third
