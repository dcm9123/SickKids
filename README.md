# T1D Project ENTRIES FROM 2026 ONLY

### February 2nd, 2026

I have decided to create a new repository that only contains the publicly available files as well as the necessary ones (as long as they are below the capacity of Github's storage). I was asked to do an annotation profile of each genome with the ECs and therefore the MetaCyc pathways. After dealing so long with MetaCyc, Kevin and I figured out that the best way to do it is to export the 'smart tables' by indicating which fields we are interested in. However, the website is crap and we can only do 5 fields at a time, then I came up with a script `pathway_metacyc_merger.py` that takes the fields I need across multiple files, and then they are merged into one large one, called `Master_Metacyc_pathway_file.tsv`. I had to come up with a list of bacterial names, genus, family, etc in order to keep a database exclusively for bacteria, as their fields are really bad and not filtered by Kingdom ...
